# Python_Contact_Book
UMD INST326 Final Project - Creating a contact book in Python

Our program is a Contact Book that operates using a command line argument that takes a filename. The sample file used to run the program is named 'contacts.txt' and contains a list of contacts. In order to run the program enter 'python3 contact.py contacts.txt' and you will be presented with a list of options in which the contacts can be added, deleted, editied, sorted, etc. Each output of the individual methods is either one contact, a list of contacts sorted or unsorted, or a message containing what was done to the contacts is printed.

This website was used when writing the save method and deciding how to open the file. This brief article detailed how to write, read, and append to a file. The reading detailed how write to a file which was needed for the add_contact, remove_contact, and update_contact methods. This helped in deciding how we would edit information contained in the file used to run the program. The
